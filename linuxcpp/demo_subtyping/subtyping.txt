The construct

class C : public Super {};

indicates that:

1) Inheritance:

C inherits from Super

Super is a base class of C

2) Subtyping:

C is a subtype of Super

Super is a supertype(not subtype!) of C

When to use Composition:
1.Composition is generally used when you want the features of an existing class inside
you new class,but not its interface.That is, you embed an object to implement features of
your new class,but the user of your new class sees the interface you've defined rather than
the interface from the original(existing) class. 
2.If there are only a few functions you want to bring through from the existing class.
In that case you're useing part of that existing class,and composition is approprite.

When to use Inheritance/Subtyping:
1.subtyping: If you want everything in the existing class to come through.
2.When you want to make a new type from an existing type and you want your new type to have 
exactly the same interface as the existing type(plus any other member functions you want to add),
so you can use it everywhere you'd use the existing type.
